          <h1>Longhorn Data Exchange</h1>
          <h2></h2>
          <p class="lead"> We believe that student organizations prosper and grow when they can efficiently learn from one another. </p>
          <p> Information exchange between student organziations is critical to the success of student organizations. Learning from other
            organizations provides the lessons of others experiences without the risk of trying something new. We have seen many organziations
            successfully adopt procedures, events, and technology from other organizations to great success, which mirros what the business world does regularly.
          </p>
          <p> However, we see that most of this experience is shared through personal connections - that is, organizations learn from one another when
            they share officers or officers are friends of one another in another student organizations. This makes connections between student organziations
            haphazard, as relationships often change depending on the social networks that exist separately from the organizations. Since organizations also
            usually elect or select new officers each year or semester, this high turnover leads to rapidly changing relationships between student organizations.
          <p> There is no centralized database of information for documenting the successes of student organizations, and although there are numerous pieces of advice,
            most officers are left to their own to find places to start when scoping out new events.
          <p class="lead"> Longhorn Data Exchange desires to create a single resource for providing all of the informational needs to guide student organization leaders to success. </p>
          <p> We ask student organizations about their experiences through forms carefully designed to capture the most important information about a specific activity.
            We then share this information in structured views with other organizations through our website to provide helpful starting points, checks, and resources
            for student organizations to succeed.
          <h2>Objectives</h2>
          <p> Currently, we are seeking to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p> Formalize our information gathering process </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> Expand to organizations outside of engineering. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2> History </h2>
          <p> The Longhorn Data Exchange was founded in Fall of 2018 by Ethan Freeburg, Anh Tran, Jonathan Wu, Justin Leung, Arjun Nagpal, and Jimmy Du. The LDE
            first worked with engineering organizations through the Student Engineering Council. </p>
