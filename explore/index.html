            <h1> Start Exploring </h1>
            <p class="lead"> Explore the insights we have collected by selecting the link on the left.</p>
            <h2>Categories</h2>
            <p> We have divided the data we collect into three major categories.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b>Operations:</b> See insights into technology and resources available for student organizations and what types of events are being hosted.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Recruiting:</b> Find opportunities within student organizations and better target specific student demographics. <i> Coming Soon.</i></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Best Practices:</b> Access the common body of knowledge for student organizations at UT Austin.<i> Coming Soon.</i></p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Use</h2>
            <p> We envision you using the provided information in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b>Options:</b> Discover what range of options are available to you that other organizations are using.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Examples:</b> Find examples of events other student organizations have executed to inspire your own events.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Experts:</b> Find organizations that have already done what you are trying to do using our events reporting.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Trends:</b> Get ahead of university-wide trends and changes by looking through our analysis.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Views </h2>
            <p> You can view information in three different forms: aggregated views, event views, or analysis.</p>

            <div class="inset p-4">
              <h3>Aggregate Views</h3>
              <p>Aggregate views provide information grouped by some characteristic. This view groups organization's experiences by a category, giving you a clean
                and straightforward way to analyze a range of options. This view also presents the many different experiences of various reporters about a single subject in a single place.
              </p>
              <p>Aggregate views are a great place to start if you are brainstorming, looking for options, or trying to see what's out there. By browsing through the aggregate view, you will see the best source
              of unique options which other organizations have already implemented.
              </p>
              <p><i> Please note that some information does not have a aggregate view because the data is inherently unique or averaged before it is entered.
              In these cases, there will be no aggregate view present.</i></p>
              <h3>Event Views</h3>
              <p> Most the information we receive is event focused, which means that it contains information only about a single organization at a single point in time. We
                treat this as the raw data behind the aggregate views we present.</p>
              <p> This information is best used to compare your specific events or plans with another organization. For example, if you want to copy a social
                from another organization, you might want to see more details about the specific event that the organization reported.</p>
              <h3>Analysis</h3>
              <p> We come across some pretty interesting insights while processing all this information. If we have any to share, you can find it posted to the analysis page.</p>
              <p> Additionally, you can find extra information about what the exchange contains and how the exchange was created through this tab. </p>
