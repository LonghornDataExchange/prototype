          <h1> Single Contribution </h1>
          <p class="lead"> Single contriubtion creates one record at a time, and is great if you only have a small amount of information
            to contribute or only need to update records.</p>

          <h2> Step 1. Fill out the Directory </h2>
          <p> Start by filling out the directory form. This form establishes some basic information we'll need to continue, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b>A Point of Contact:</b> The Point of Contact is the person whom the Longhorn Data Exchange will be primarily contact.
                Usually, we would recommend this to be the president of the organization, but it can be any officer or designated individual. The
                only qualification is that we must be able to communicate with them. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p><b>The Organization Objectives:</b> Every organization is designed to serve some purpose, and we want to know what that purpose is.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p><b>Basic Logistic Information:</b> we collect some other contact information from your organization, such as website and office location, to provide
                 other organizations with relevant contact information and provide a place for students to learn more about your organization.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p><b>Basic Size Information:</b> We ask about membership and budget to gather a rough estimate of the size and nature of the organization. This helps
                 other organizations understand whether their organization is comparable to yours.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2> Step 2. Direct your officers to fill out the relevant single contriubtion links </h2>
          <p> Each form is intended for a specific role in your organization. These roles may be the responsibility of a single officer or a group of officers. We ask that you
            forward the appropriate forms to the appropriate officers. </p>
          <p> You can use the following table to determine who should complete which forms:</p>
